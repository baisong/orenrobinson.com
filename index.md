#### *Tech Worker, Candidate for County Committee CA-78, Vote March 3rd, 2020*

*Open Up the Local Party*

As a San Diego resident in these times, I believe we have a duty to learn and consider our histories as we work together to ensure rights and equitable opportunities for all.

Since the first violent invasions of Kumeyaay Land in 1769 through today, greedy wealthy people and institutions have hoarded money and power in San Diego by dividing working class people, and disproportionately harming Black, Indigenous, People of Color, and TLGBQ+ communities. But histories like the [Lemon Grove Incident](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lemon_Grove_Incident), the [formation of Chicano Park](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chicano_Park) and the [numerous](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2006_United_States_immigration_reform_protests) [large-scale mobilizations](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Protests_against_Executive_Order_13769) for [Black](https://www.pslweb.org/san_diego_alton_philando), [Intersectional](https://www.m4bwsd.com/), [Immigrant](https://www.facebook.com/CloseConcentrationCampsSD/) and [Refugee](https://www.facebook.com/RRNSanDiego/) [human rights and liberation](https://www.espaciomigrante.org/) shows that we in the San Diego-Tijuana region are all in this together.

All San Diegans have the power to not only elect representatives who work for the people, but demand and win long-overdue changes just like we have in the past.

#### Why I'm Running

We need to open up the party. Having been elected Secretary and serving on the Executive Board of the San Diego County Democratic Party since January 2019, I believe that we need a culture shift towards equitable access and mass participation if we want to be a people's party. As a representative on the County Committee, I pledge:

- To be available to and answer to all current and future residents, not just voters,
- To fight for internal policies to make participation accessible for all community members: with language support, childcare, food, and remote options at meetings,
- To fight for public policy platforms and actions that foster public understanding of local issues informed by grassroots histories and ongoing movements, and
- To pass the mic: share my voting stick with activists who want to attend and vote at regular monthly meetings

There are nearly 1 million registered Democrats in San Diego County. All 3.5 million San Diegans deserve a Democratic Party where more than just a few hundred active members and donors make important decisions like who becomes endorsed in local races and how we spend our collective resources.

I know we can transform the party to include tens of thousands of people mobilizing and educating our community to bring about local, regional and national change: Black Lives Matter. Indigenous Sovereignty. No Human Being is Illegal. Stop Surveilling Muslims. End Endless Wars. Housing is a Human Right. Healthcare is a Human Right. Climate Justice. All of our fights are interlocking, and none of us are free until we are all free.

#### About me

Since 2010, with a background in open source software development, consensus-based decision-making and cooperative business operation, I have volunteered and contracted technology services to dozens of grassroots progressive projects including local progressive candidates, nonprofits, and community groups and initiatives. I was a founding volunteer-turned-Associate Director of [Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA)](https://www.panasd.org) from 2014-2017. I was elected and served as treasurer of [San Diego Refugee Forum](http://www.sdrefugeeforum.org/) from 2016-2018, and am a member of [Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) San Diego Chapter](https://surjsandiego.org/), [Jewish Voice for Peace San Diego](https://www.jvpsandiego.org/), [Tech Worker Coalition (TWC) San Diego Chapter](https://www.meetup.com/TWCSanDiego), and was elected and am currently serving as Secretary for the [San Diego County Democratic Party](https://sdcdp.ngpvanhost.com/executive-board).

I am currently building free tech tools for community organizers as [Include People](https://www.patreon.com/includepeople), including [Every Public Meeting](https://www.everypublicmeeting.com), a website to make it easy to find, attend, and take part in every meeting: county, city, school, and local.

Please get in touch with any questions. I hope to earn your vote!

Hi, I'm Oren Robinson. My pronouns are he or they. I'm a tech organizer living on occupied Kumeyaay land, also known as San Diego, California. My family descends from English, Jewish, German, Scottish and Irish settlers during the 1400s-1800s. I was raised on Haudenosaunee land in so-called Central New York by a joint-custody family of activists, artists and dropouts.

I studied computer science in college. That's when fellow students challenged me to confront patriarchy and racism. That's also when I studied in China and experienced life in a second language, and the privileges of being a white US citizen in another colonized place.

For the past 10 years since, I've helped facilitate, design and build websites, web apps and tech projects for dozens of social justice groups and projects. In that time I have developed a technology practice informed by the principles of collective decision-making, transformative justice and being hella cheap. I've been a part of grassroots groups, open source, nonprofits, political campaigns and mutual aid work.

I also organize with [Organizing White Men for Collective Liberation](https://www.owmcl.org/), [Jewish Voice for Peace San Diego](https://www.jvpsandiego.org/), [SURJ San Diego](http://linktr.ee/surjsandiego), [Tech Worker Coalition San Diego](https://www.meetup.com/TWCSanDiego), and currently serve as secretary of the [San Diego County Democratic Party](https://sdcdp.ngpvanhost.com/executive-board) (through January 2021).

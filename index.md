üëãüèª Hi, I'm Oren Robinson. My pronouns are he or they.

I'm a tech worker living on occupied Kumeyaay land, also known as san diego, california.

My family descends from English, Jewish, Celtic, and Germanic settlers during the 1600s-1800s. I was raised on occupied Haudenosaunee land in so-called central and western new york state by a joint-custody family of activists, artists and dropouts.

I studied computer science in college. That's when fellow students challenged me to confront patriarchy and white supremacy. That's also when I lived in China for 2 years, immersed in a second language as a white US citizen studying and working in Shanghai, rural Sichuan, and Beijing.

For the past 10 years, I've helped groups design and build websites, web apps and digital communications for community-building and systems change work. In that time I have developed a technology practice informed by the principles of collective design & ownership, working myself out of a job, and being hella cheap ‚Äî or contributing volunteer tech as an active member or supporter of a grassroots group, cooperative, open source project, nonprofit, political campaign or mutual aid network.

These days I make free tech activism resources and tools and hold free social justice tech office hours at [Include People](https://www.includepeople.com/), a collaboration space which you can [follow and support on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/includepeople).

I'm also part of [Organizing White Men for Collective Liberation](https://www.owmcl.org/), [Jewish Voice for Peace San Diego](https://www.jvpsandiego.org/), [Espacio Migrante](https://www.espaciomigrante.org/), [Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ)'s board](https://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/leadership-team.html) and [San Diego chapter](http://linktr.ee/surjsandiego) and [Tech Workers Coalition San Diego](https://twcsandiego.org/).

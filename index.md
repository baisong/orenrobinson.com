I believe that a rising tide lifts all boats.

As a San Diego resident in these times, I believe we have a duty to learn and consider our histories as we work together to ensure equitable opportunity for all of our community members: Indigenous communities, descendents of American Chattel Slavery, Criminal Injustice System-impacted, housing-insecure, food-insecure, low-income, women, parents, LGBTQ+, Latinx, Black and Brown, undocumented, immigrant, refugee, Muslim, Jewish, community members with disabilities, and all souls and communities. We are all in this together, and while we face urgent challenges, when we all stick together we all win.

Since 2010, with a background in open source technology and consensus-based cooperative business operation, I have volunteered and contracted technology services to dozens of grassroots progressive projects including local progressive candidates, nonprofits, community groups and individuals. I was a founding volunteer-turned-Associate Director of [Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA)](https://www.panasd.org) from 2014-2017. I served as treasurer of [San Diego Refugee Forum](http://www.sdrefugeeforum.org/) from 2016-2018, and am a member-trainer with [Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) San Diego Chapter](https://surjsandiego.org/), a member of [Jewish Voice for Peace San Diego](https://www.jvpsandiego.org/), and working to establish a [Tech Worker Coalition (TWC) San Diego Chapter](https://www.meetup.com/TWCSanDiego).

I am currently building free tech tools for community organizers as [Include People](https://www.patreon.com/includepeople), recently launching [Every Public Meeting](https://www.everypublicmeeting.com), a website to make it easy to find, attend, and take part in every meeting: county, city, school, and local. I am proficient in Mandarin Chinese and working on Spanish proficiency.

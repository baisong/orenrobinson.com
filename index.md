#### *Tech Worker, Candidate for County Committee CA-78, Vote March 3rd, 2020*

I believe that a rising tide lifts all boats.

As a San Diego resident in these times, I believe we have a duty to learn and consider our histories as we work together to ensure rights and equitable opportunities for all.

Since the first violent invasions of Kumeyaay Land in 1769, through today, greedy wealthy people and institutions hoarded money and power and by dividing working class people, and disproportionately harming Black, Indigenous, People of Color, and TLGBQ+ communities. But histories like the [Lemon Grove Incident](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lemon_Grove_Incident), the [formation of Chicano Park](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chicano_Park) and the [numerous](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2006_United_States_immigration_reform_protests) [large-scale mobilizations](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Protests_against_Executive_Order_13769) for [immigrant](https://www.facebook.com/CloseConcentrationCampsSD/) and [refugee](https://www.facebook.com/RRNSanDiego/) human rights shows that San Diegans are all in this together. While we face urgent challenges, when we fight for each other we all win.

#### Why I'm Running

Having served on the Executive Board of the San Diego County Democratic Central Committee, I believe that we need a culture shift towards equitable access and mass participation. As a representative on the County Committee, I pledge:

- To be available to and answer to all current and future residents, not just voters,
- To fight for internal policies to make participation accessible for all community members: with language support, childcare, food, and remote options at meetings,
- To fight for public policy platforms and actions that foster public understanding of local issues informed by grassroots histories and ongoing movements, and
- To pass the mic: share my voting stick with activists who want to attend and vote at regular monthly meetings

#### About me

Since 2010, with a background in open source software development, consensus-based decision-making and cooperative business operation, I have volunteered and contracted technology services to dozens of grassroots progressive projects including local progressive candidates, nonprofits, and community groups and initiatives. I was a founding volunteer-turned-Associate Director of [Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA)](https://www.panasd.org) from 2014-2017. I was elected and served as treasurer of [San Diego Refugee Forum](http://www.sdrefugeeforum.org/) from 2016-2018, and am a member of [Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) San Diego Chapter](https://surjsandiego.org/), [Jewish Voice for Peace San Diego](https://www.jvpsandiego.org/), [Tech Worker Coalition (TWC) San Diego Chapter](https://www.meetup.com/TWCSanDiego), and was elected and am currently serving as Secretary for the [San Diego County Democratic Party](https://sdcdp.ngpvanhost.com/executive-board).

I am currently building free tech tools for community organizers as [Include People](https://www.patreon.com/includepeople), including [Every Public Meeting](https://www.everypublicmeeting.com), a website to make it easy to find, attend, and take part in every meeting: county, city, school, and local.

Please get in touch with any questions. I hope to earn your vote!

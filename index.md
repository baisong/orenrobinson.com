### My candidate statement

I believe that a rising tide lifts all boats.

As a San Diego resident in these times, I believe we have a duty to learn and consider our histories as we work together to ensure equitable opportunity for all of our community members: Indigenous communities, descendents of American Chattel Slavery, Criminal Injustice System-impacted, housing-insecure, food-insecure, low-income, women, parents, LGBTQ+, Latinx, Black and Brown, undocumented, immigrant, refugee, Muslim, Jewish, community members with disabilities, and all souls and communities. We are all in this together, and while we face urgent challenges, when we all stick together we all win.

My name is Oren Robinson and I commit to fairness, courage, and accountability in public service, including this race for California Democratic State Central Committee Delegate for the 2019 and 2020 conventions. I have lived in the 78th Assembly District since 2014.

With a background in open source technology and consensus-based cooperative business operation, I was the founding Associate Director of Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA) in 2014, a non-profit, refugee-led community organizing, research and public policy hub based in City Heights, San Diego. Since 2010, I have volunteered and contracted technology services to dozens of grassroots progressive projects including local democratic candidates, nonprofits, groups and individuals. I served as treasurer of San Diego Refugee Forum from 2016-2018, and am a member-trainer with Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) San Diego Chapter, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, and working to establish a Tech Worker Coalition (TWC) San Diego Chapter. I am proficient in Mandarin Chinese and working on Spanish proficiency.

I support and will advance a platform of issues and priorities, including: Reform of the Democratic Party & Leadership, Medicare for All, Paid Family Sick Leave, Free Quality Education, $15 Minimum Wage, Right to a Union, Social Justice, Wall Street & Banking Reform, Taxing the Wealthy, Racial Justice, Environmental Justice, Divesting from Big Oil, Banning Fossil Fuel Extraction, Getting Money Out of Politics, Fair Election Processes, Criminal Justice Reform, Equal Pay for Women, and Endorsing Progressive Candidates for Office.

This is why I ask you for your vote. Thank you for your consideration.
